This project proposes transport to Mars several greenhouses-biodomes based on the Hoberman sphere with a robotic arm inside. The hardware selected is Mega Arduino.
Andean quinoa was chosen to grow on Mars, because it’s rich in essential amino acids, consumes moderate water, doesn’t need pollination and lives at low temperatures.
We propose a self-sustaining process in order to reuse the ammonia and convert nitrates, with the help of a fish (Tilapia). A second objective is to provide animal protein to humans.
Finally the robot will gather the biological waste in an external tank to make compost for bio-fertilizer
